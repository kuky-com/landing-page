   	question:"Why does Kuky ask for a video during sign-up?",
   	answer:
   		`We ask for a short video during sign-up to help keep our community safe, authentic, and free from fake accounts. Every profile is manually reviewed to ensure each member is a real person with genuine intentions â€” this helps us protect the integrity of our peer-to-peer space.

		That said, we completely understand how being on video â€” especially on the spot â€” can feel overwhelming. You're definitely not alone in feeling that way, and we appreciate your courage in showing up. You can record your intro video as many times as you like until youâ€™re happy with it. No pressure, no rush.

		We're also actively exploring additional ways for people to express themselves beyond video while still keeping the same level of trust and connection within the community.

		Your comfort and safety matter to us â€” thanks for being part of Kuky ðŸ’›`

      "Kuky is an AI-powered app that analyzes users' videos to match them with others who share similar interests and hobbies. Our platform allows you to create a unique profile by uploading two videos - one public video introducing yourself to the community, and another private video analyzed solely for matching purposes.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Kuky analyze my video?",
    answer:
      "Our advanced artificial intelligence algorithms process the visual content, audio, speech patterns, and metadata of your video to identify shared interests, passions, and activities. We do not store or distribute this information beyond its intended use in our secure system.",
  },
  // {
  //     question: "Is it safe to upload my private video to Kuky?",
  //     answer: "Absolutely! Protecting user data and privacy is paramount at Kuky. The analysis of your private video takes place within a highly secured environment using end-to-end encryption.

  {
    question:
      "Why should I choose Kuky over traditional social media platforms?",

  {
    question:
      "Will anyone know if I swipe left or right on someone else's profile?",

  },
  {
    question:
      "Are there any restrictions on the type of content allowed in my videos?",
